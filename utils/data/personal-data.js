  description: "Hey there, I'm AKASH KUMAR! I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable systems and optimizing performance. With experience at companies like ServiceNow, AMD, and Amazon, I've worked on high-impact projects handling millions of requests daily. I love diving deep into algorithms, distributed systems, and solving complex technical challenges.",
  description2: "Backend wizard here! 🚀 I'm all about making systems faster, smarter, and more scalable. Think database optimization, microservices that actually work, and code that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. I've squeezed out 40% faster retrieval times and 35% speedier searches—because who likes waiting, right? When I'm not geeking out over clean code and new tech, you'll catch me crushing LeetCode problems (1730+ rating, no big deal 😎) or competing in programming contests. Always down to build something cool together!",
